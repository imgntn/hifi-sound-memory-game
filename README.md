- use node server.js to start the high score API
- inside of high fidelity, load one of the game scrcipts:
- scripts/simon.js --> the blocks are arranged in front of you
- scripts/simon-surround.js --> the blocks are arranged in a circle around you.

todo:
- reduce block size to human proportions so that it plays better inside of closed spaces.
- integrate distributeItemsAroundCircle.js for dynamic distribution of blocks
- make the number of blocks dynamic
- add additional sound sample sets
- user upload of their own sounds
- try different shapes
- try different animations
- record all playback instead of only final score?
